# storm-os
Very basic OS being created following this blog: https://os.phil-opp.com/

## Setup
If you are using `rust-analyzer` with VSCode, it is recommended to add this to your `settings.json` file in order to avoid errors being shown that aren't actually happening.
```
{
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.allTargets": false,
}
```
